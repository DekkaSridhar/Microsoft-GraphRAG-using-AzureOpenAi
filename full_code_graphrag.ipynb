The condition improved significantly after treatment with methylprednisolone, betamethasone dipropionate cream, pramoxine lotion, and oral cetirizine [Data: Entities (14, 28); Relationships (20, 22, 27, 35, 36, 38)]. \n",

In one documented case, an 89-year-old male developed a widespread purpuric cutaneous eruption secondary to linezolid use. The patient presented with pruritic, non-blanchable purpuric macules and patches that began five days after starting linezolid therapy for healthcare-associated pneumonia. Histopathology revealed a superficial and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with dermal eosinophils, consistent with a purpuric drug eruption [Data: Entities (12, 7, 28); Relationships (22, 20, 38)].\n",

Specific conditions linked to Allopurinol include DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). In one case, Allopurinol's direct toxicity contributed to a patient's renal damage and subsequent death. The Human Pathology Department confirmed diagnoses of DRESS and SJS in patients taking Allopurinol, highlighting the severe risks associated with the medication [Data: Entities (28, 42, 50); Relationships (20, 39, 51, 66)]. \n",
