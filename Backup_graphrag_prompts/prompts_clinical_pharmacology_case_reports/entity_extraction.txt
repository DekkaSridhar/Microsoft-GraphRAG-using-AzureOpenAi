-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Example 1:

text:
]
. However, a literature review by Perone et al. in 2019 that examined 19 articles showed that
66% of the BAIT syndrome cases analyzed in those articles involved patients who had taken moxifloxacin
[4]
. Based on the aforementioned finding, the authors concluded that it is impossible to entirely exclude
moxifloxacin toxicity as a potential cause of BAIT syndrome.
Our case report adds a unique perspective to this debate since our patientâ€™s moxifloxacin overdose occurred
after having initiated treatment for a urinary tract infection and showed no evidence of upper respiratory
viral infection. To our knowledge, this is the second reported case of BAIT syndrome in a patient with a
previous bacterial urinary tract infection. In 2016, Degirmenci et al. reported on an isolated case of BAIT
syndrome in a patient with an untreated 
Escherichia coli 
urinary tract infection, which suggests that viral
infections are not the sole potential triggers of this syndrome
