-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Example 1:

text:
 that our patient had a BAIT syndrome diagnosis following a moxifloxacin overdose (after having
taken 800 mg over the prescribed daily dosage) is evidence that moxifloxacin toxicity may be a trigger for
said syndrome. Previous studies have shown that the oral administration of moxifloxacin results in
relatively similar concentrations in the aqueous and vitreous humor and can reach toxic concentrations in
the iris pigment epithelium 
[4]
. The proposed mechanism is that moxifloxacin has a high affinity for
melanin-containing structures, such as the iris, which could result in phototoxicity 
[4]
. In vitro studies by
Perin et al. (2015) showed a decreased viability of human iris pigment cells after exposure to high
concentrations of moxifloxacin 
[9]
. Cell viability decreased by 84.12% after the administration of 100 ug/mL
of moxifloxacin compared to what was seen in the control group. Though 100 ug/mL is a high concentration
compared to the normal therapeutic intraocular concentration, theoretically, a moxifloxacin overdose could
lead to the significant toxicity associated with the high concentration of the
