Abstract: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a drug
reaction commonly related to eosinophilia, from uncertain epidemiology, and without consensus
for diagnosis and treatment globally. It presents a great challenge in its management and is charac-
terized by fever, lymphadenopathy, skin rash, and multisystemic involvement. An aggressive and
difÔ¨Åcult-to-manage clinical case is presented in a 50-year-old man with chronic kidney disease due
to diabetes mellitus type 2 and systemic arterial hypertension, who developed an unusual variant
similar to DRESS and Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome (SJS) overlap secondary to allopurinol, with skin
manifestations without eosinophilia, but fulÔ¨Ålling clinical and laboratory criteria for DRESS and
SJS syndrome.

1. Introduction
DRESS syndrome is a rare but potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction to
drugs that can involve multiple organ systems. It was Ô¨Årst described in 1996 by Bouquet,
and it belongs to the group of severe adverse reactions to drugs (SCARs). The other SCARs
are acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS),
and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) [1].
The incidence of DRESS syndrome is estimated to be 1 in 1000‚Äì10,000 drug exposures.
It is more common in certain populations, particularly African-American and Caribbean
populations [ 2]. There is no gender preference, and the age of onset can range from infancy
to adulthood. The most associated drugs with DRESS syndrome are aromatic anticon-
vulsants such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital, as well as sulfonamides,
dapsone, minocycline, allopurinol, calcium channel blockers, terbinaÔ¨Åne, nonsteroidal
anti-inÔ¨Çammatory drugs, and antiretroviral drugs [1].

One of the main clinical manifestations of DRESS syndrome is a maculopapular rash,
which can be accompanied by fever and other systemic symptoms [ 3]. The onset of symp-
toms usually occurs within 2 to 6 weeks after exposure to the culprit drug. Fulminant liver
failure is the most common cause of death, with a mortality rate of 10‚Äì20%. The true inci-
dence of DRESS/DIHS is still unknown, but it has been reported at around 10 per million .
DRESS syndrome can recur; a systematic review that included 42 articles concluded that
the average time to recurrence is 124 days, it usually presents with a higher fever and a
higher number of eosinophils, generally attributed to another causal drug. In this study, it
is mentioned that the survival of recurrences was 71% [4‚Äì6].
SJS is a rare, life-threatening mucocutaneous reaction that can also be caused by drug
exposure. It has an incidence of 1.5‚Äì6.0 cases per million, and it is characterized by the
detachment of the epidermis from the dermis, leading to widespread skin blistering and
mucosal erosions. SJS is differentiated from TEN by the percentage of body surface area
affected: <than 10% for SJS, 10‚Äì30% for SJS/TEN overlap, and >30% for TEN [7].
A study conducted in 2023 aimed to estimate the incidence of SJS/TEN and included a
total of 51,040 hospitalizations. The results showed a predominance of SJS (73%), followed
by the SJS/TEN overlap (15.3%) and TEN (14%). Females were more frequently affected
(57.2%), and the highest mortality was observed in patients with TEN (15%). Advanced age,
chronic kidney disease, pneumonia, and neoplasms were also associated with mortality in
SJS/TEN [8].
Although there are no speciÔ¨Åc literature or clinical studies available on the overlap
of DRESS/SJS syndrome, these SCARs share overlapping clinical manifestations that can
sometimes make it challenging to differentiate them. The diagnostic and therapeutic
approach to treating DRESS/SJS overlap is a complex issue that requires further research.
2. Case Report
A 50-year-old man arrived at the emergency department with a widespread scaly rash
covering his face, chest, abdomen, and back. He also had facial swelling, lymphadenopathy,
and mucous membrane involvement (see Figure 1A,B). Upon admission, his physical
examination revealed a temperature of 37.8C, weight of 80 kg, height of 1.78 m, and a
BMI of 25.3. According to family members, he had been taking 300 mg of allopurinol for
two weeks before the rash‚Äôs appearance as he was diagnosed with hyperuricemia. He had
also experienced a fever and upper respiratory tract illness the week before. The patient
had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years, multiple lower limb amputations
due to diabetic neuropathy and poorly controlled hypertension being treated with losartan
and metformin and rapid-acting insulin. Upon admission, we stopped the suspected
drug using the Naranjo score. The patient was uncooperative and obtunded. Laboratory
abnormalities included a Hb of 8.97 g/dL, hematocrit (HTO) of 29.3%, white blood cells
(WBC) of 19.3 K/ L, eosinophils of 0.002 K/ L, platelets of 295,000/mm3plasma glucose
level of 143 mg/dL, serum creatinine level of 10.3 mg/dL, BUN level of 150 mg/dL,
serum potassium level of 7.2 mmol/L, serum sodium level of 156 mmol/L, and abnormal
liver function tests including AST level of 120 UI/L, ALT level of 113 UI/L, ALP level
of439 UI/L , total bilirubin level of 3.3 mg/dL, direct bilirubin level of 1.9 mg/dL, and
LDH level of 331 UI/L. We consulted nephrology for hemodialysis and dermatology for
a suspected drug-induced skin reaction. Dermatology performed a skin biopsy, which
revealed a spongiotic and acantholytic lesion, suggesting an epidermal necrolysis (see
Figure 2A‚ÄìE). Although no tests were carried out to identify the reactivation of HHV 6‚Äì7
or EBV , the human pathology department diagnosed Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, and the
clinical features met the criteria for DRESS. We initiated intravenous corticosteroid therapy
at a dose of 4 mg/kg/BID, which was later increased to 8 mg/kg/BID due to poor clinical
response (see Figure 1B).Life2023 ,13, 2251 3 of 8

3. Discussion
The pathophysiological basis of the disease is not fully understood, but it is identiÔ¨Åed
as a type 4b delayed hypersensitivity mechanism according to the Coombs and Gell
classiÔ¨Åcation [ 9]. There are also different proposed mechanisms, including issues in drug
metabolism, slow acetylation, and reactivation of the Epstein Barr, HSV 6, and 7 viruses [ 10].
Recent evidence indicates an association between speciÔ¨Åc HLA haplotypes and the use of
certain medications with a higher risk of developing this syndrome. For instance, HLA B
13:01 haplotype has been linked to the use of dapsone, HLA B 58:01 to allopurinol, and
HLA B 32:01 to vancomycin [ 11]. DRESS syndrome is characterized by cutaneous and
hematological manifestations with multisystemic involvement. Symptoms usually start
between 2 and 90 days with an average of 23 days after consumption of the causative
drug [ 12]. It usually involves a prodromal period characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy,
pruritus, and Ô¨Çu-like symptoms [9].
In a recent study that included 125 patients who met DRESS criteria, it was found
that the rash usually involves typically >50% of the body surface area (BSA) in 97.6% of
cases a maculopapular morphology shown to be the most prevalent (84.6%). Typical facial
edema appears in up to 53.8% and mucosal involvement occurs in up to 32.8% [ 5]. In
another study that included 27 patients with DRESS, 100% of the sample had a history
of fever, 88.8% developed lymphadenopathy, 92.5% had eosinophilia, and the liver was
primarily involved in 100% of cases [ 13]. The liver plays a central role in this disease and is
the main cause of death. A systematic review, aimed at identifying other affected organs,
indicated that esophagitis, gastritis, enteritis, colitis, pancreatitis, and even fulminant type
1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus may also be present in this syndrome [ 14].
The Naranjo score is a questionnaire that includes 10 questions whose objective is to
determine the presence of an adverse drug reaction. A score of 0 suggests a doubtful
diagnosis, 1‚Äì4 points indicate a possible reaction, 5‚Äì8 points suggest probability, and a
score9 points establishes the diagnosis of an adverse drug reaction. Naranjo score alone
has low sensitivity, and clinical judgment is necessary to avoid underestimation [ 15,16].
Several diagnostic criteria for DRESS syndrome exist, including those proposed by Bouquet
in 1996, criteria by the RegiSCAR group, and those established by the Japanese J-SCAR
consensus. (Table 1).

Drugs associated with DRESS syndrome are associated with speciÔ¨Åc organ damage,
allopurinol has been shown to target the kidney, phenytoin causes liver damage, and
carbamazepine causes damage to both. (Table 2).

A skin biopsy is necessary to rule out other potential conditions, as the observed
changes are not usually pathognomonic of DRESS. These changes include spongiosis,
subcorneal pustules, apoptotic keratinocytes, mixed inÔ¨Åltrates of the superÔ¨Åcial dermis,
vacuolar changes, and extravasation [ 17]. The differential diagnosis should include other
severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as SJS, TEN, and SJS-TEN overlap. The
latter conditions are often related to the same drugs linked to DRESS syndrome and share a
similar prodromal period. SJS/TEN may manifest in the skin as erythematous or violaceous
patches, atypical targetoid lesions, bullae, erosions, and necrosis. The bullae is usually
associated with a positive Nikolsky sign. Around 80% of patients with SJS/TEN may
have mucosal involvement [ 7]. Another SCAR to consider in the differential diagnosis is
AGEP , which manifests as non-follicular pustules on an erythematous base, distributed
favorably to the extremities (44.2%), trunk (23.3%), face (23.3%), and potential involvement
the oral mucosa (11.6%) [ 18]. In the current context, the differential diagnosis should
include adverse skin reactions induced by the vaccine vs. COVID-19, which can cause
redness to morbilliform to urticarial rashes [19].
Studies have also identiÔ¨Åed various factors associated with mortality in patients with
SJS/TEN, including advanced age, chronic kidney disease, pneumonia, and neoplasms [ 8].
Additionally, research has demonstrated that the number of criteria fulÔ¨Ålled according to
the RegiSCAR group‚Äôs classiÔ¨Åcation system can indicate the aggressiveness of DRESS, with
facial edema being a particularly signiÔ¨Åcant cutaneous parameter in determining a more se-
vere form of the syndrome [ 20]. Another study involving 91 patients diagnosed with DRESS
reported 13 fatalities, with speciÔ¨Åc clinical markers such as age over 40, increased heart
rate, fever, elevated BUN levels, leukopenia or leukocytosis, and elevated ALT and AST
levels associated with poor prognosis [ 21]. The severity scoring system for DiHS/DRESS
has proven useful in monitoring severity, predicting prognosis, and stratifying the risk of
developing CMV disease and complications [ 22]. The initial step in treatment is the imme-
diate discontinuation of the offending drug [ 1]. The primary pharmacological treatment for
DRESS involves systemic corticosteroids. Recommended doses include intravenous dex-
amethasone (4‚Äì8 mg/kg/every 8‚Äì12 h) and IV methylprednisolone (10‚Äì30 mg/kg/dose)
during the Ô¨Årst week, followed by tapering with prednisolone (0.5‚Äì2 mg/kg/day ) ad-
ministered in 2‚Äì3 months. Systemic corticosteroid treatment is gradually tapered over
3 months [ 23]. As an alternative treatment for DRESS, the effectiveness of cyclosporine,
a calcineurin inhibitor and potent immunosuppressant has been demonstrated. This is
particularly beneÔ¨Åcial for patients who experience adverse reactions to corticosteroids. The
initial dose of cyclosporine is 3‚Äì5 mg/kg/day, the dose is increased or decreased up to
50 mg based on the response of the patient, and the duration of treatment ranges from 35
to 76 days [24].
A retrospective cohort study published in 2023 whose objective was to compare the
use of systemic steroids vs. topical use in the treatment of DRESS syndrome included
94 patients , 44% received treatment with topical steroids, while the remaining 56% received
IV steroids. Patients treated with IV corticosteroids had a higher risk of infectious complica-
tions; however, no difference in mortality or hospital stay was found. The study concludes
that the use of topical corticosteroids is controversial, but may be a safe and effective alter-Life2023 ,13, 2251 6 of 8
native, but with a slow response in mild-moderate DRESS [ 25]. Treatment with IV steroids
should not be changed rapidly to topical therapy; instead should be tapered progressively
in order to prevent relapses, even when the clinical evolution is favorable [26].
4. Conclusions
The case of our patient presented a diagnostic challenge, showcasing a rare and
potentially lethal combination of DRESS and SJS syndromes. Despite the absence of
eosinophilia, which is characteristic of DRESS, the patient fulÔ¨Ålled the majority of the
diagnostic criteria established by both the RegiSCAR and J-SCAR groups. Additionally, the
patient exhibited a scaly exanthema, a feature observed in a small percentage of patients
with DRESS [ 3,13]. Notably, our patient had severe mucosal and eye involvement, similar
to SJS patients, and displayed a positive Nikolsky sign in certain areas of his body.
Managing this case was further complicated by the patient‚Äôs chronic kidney disease,
exacerbated by allopurinol-induced kidney damage. This complexity made it challenging
to adequately replenish insensible losses and excluded the use of cyclosporine, a drug
that has shown utility in treating DRESS/SJS. Certain clinical and biochemical parameters,
including elevated thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) levels, C-reactive
protein levels over 5 mg/L, extensive skin rash covering more than 35% of the body surface
area, and eosinophilia over 6%, have been identiÔ¨Åed as predictors of severe DRESS [27].
It should be emphasized that true overlaps, where a patient meets the diagnostic
criteria for two SCARs simultaneously, are very uncommon but can occur. The limited
scientiÔ¨Åc literature on overlaps is surprising, considering that the causative drugs are
typically the same. Reported cases, such as the overlap between DRESS and SJS due to
allopurinol and DRESS and AGEP due to piperacillin/tazobactam, highlight the importance
of suspecting overlaps and acting swiftly when overlapping clinical or histopathological
features are present [ 28,29]. A retrospective study aimed at identifying overlaps among
SCARs revealed that 21% of the 216 patients studied had two possible diagnoses, with
only 2.1% being true SCARs [ 30]. Additionally, a series of two cases of DRESS/SJS-TEN
overlap due to benznidazole reported by Gonzalez Ramos et al. emphasizes the diagnostic
challenge of this situation and the need for quick suspicion and treatment due to its
potential life-threatening nature [31].
In conclusion, our patient features clinical, laboratory, and biopsy parameters that
meet the criteria for DREES and SJS. It was a rare and complex case in the diagnosis and
management that requires high suspicion and rapid intervention because of its potential
lethality. Both drug reactions are by themselves life-threatening conditions and together
are even worse. Further research and understanding of SCAR /acute.ts1s overlaps are necessary to
improve diagnostic accuracy and guide clinicians in managing these complex cases.
